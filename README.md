# Markovitz portfolio optimisation tool using solver in Google Sheets.

**Please see [my Reddit post](
https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/crmpx7/i_made_a_portfolio_optimisation_tool_spreadsheet/) explaining how to use the portfolio optimisation tool in detail. This post includes instructions on how to use the spreadsheet and some explanation behind it.**


**Note:** The portfolio sheet and automatic emailer referenced in the Reddit post no longer exist in this verison of the spreadsheet. To view a portfolio with similar functions see [my portfolio tracker repository](https://github.com/GeorgeBates98/Portfolio-Tracker).

Alternatively view the [Markovitz Portfolio Optimisation Tool spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OTRZ1oOG-yJLo3H3M0F6GXn3rloo3R0Ag_vTqY0cjao/edit?usp=sharing) and [instructions document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cbr60isKWouA0y-alByTX7fkFoXMAIcH4gkhhGu0qpI/edit?usp=sharing).
